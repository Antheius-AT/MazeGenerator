This project is a simple maze generator coded in C#.

It was developed as part of my Bachelor's program in computer science at FHWN.

The WPF part of this project is unfinished, as the rendering is only functional on the console, which was sufficient as per the requirements.

I originally had plans to finish rendering of the maze in WPF aswell, however these plans as of today have never been completed.
